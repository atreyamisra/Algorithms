1. 80_80_100.in 

- It is a test case with 80 nodes. 
- x and y ranges are from 0 to 80.
- Latency range is from 0 to 100.

The first line of this file has those information above (80 80 100).
And it shows coordinates of 80 nodes, followed by the list of latencies for all possible edges.

2. output_gpsr (transmission range = 10-meter)

- It has the result of our code for GPSR with t = 10.
- The result shows possible paths, successful rate and running time.
- Having different result should be rare as the test nodes has Real number for x,y (not Integer).

3. output_dijLat (transmission range = 10-meter)

- It has the result of our code for Dijkstra-latency with t = 10.
- The result shows possible paths, successful rate and running time.
- Having different result should be rare as the test nodes has Real number for x,y (not Integer).

4. output_dijHops (transmission range = 10-meter)

- It has the result of our code for Dijkstra-Hops with t = 10.
- The result shows successful rate and running time.
- Having different result should be rare as the test nodes has Real number for x,y (not Integer).
